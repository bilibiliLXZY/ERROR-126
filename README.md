# ERROR-126
The Minecraft ERROR 126 will upgrade at here.

Please **TELL ME THE ISSUES** if it occurres!

This is __VERY IMPORTANT__!

Umm... my obfuscator was broken... so I won't obfuscate any versions...

This is __only__ for _report bugs_ and ***upgrade new version*** use.

If you can't run the version, please rename the obf.jar to mc.jar! 
## Why did I create it?
Umm... Because I just want to do it. :l
